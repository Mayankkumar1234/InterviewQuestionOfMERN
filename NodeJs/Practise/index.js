//  Node js achieve aysnchronous programming using its event driven approach 

// Steps for Handling Asynchronous Operations :-

// 1. CallBacks : Functions passed as arguments and executed after an async task completes , ensuring non-blocking execution.

// Promises : Represent the eventual result of an async task , enabling chaining with .then() and .catch()  for continue processing..

// Async / Await  :- Simplifies async programming by pausing code execution at await until a promise resolves.
