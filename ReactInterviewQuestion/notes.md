# What is Reconciliation
- Reconciliation in React is the process of efficiently updating the user interface (UI) to match changes in component state or props. When a component's data changes, React creates a new virtual DOM tree and compares it to the previous one. This comparison, known as "diffing," identifies the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM. Instead of re-rendering the entire UI, React applies only these specific updates, resulting in improved performance

 # useRef -
 -The useRef hook allows you to persist values between renders and accessing real DOM elements.

-So, you can define another state and store the previous value. Then, in an event like clicking or etc., check the current and previous value
